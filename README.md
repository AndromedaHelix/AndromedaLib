# AndromedaLib
Library for the FIRST Robotics Competition

The library aims at removing bulky code, making object-oriented initialization easier and faster. Furthermore, it includes many wrappers and objets for different components used during the competition, such as KualiLab's NavX IMU, Rev Robotic's Blinkin LED Lights, Limelight, Photonvision, and more. It also includes several useful math-related functions to simplify robot programming and debugging.
